  - Hey, Blink. Come here for a second.
  - 'I''ve got this problem. It''s about my wife. '
  - You know I love her. Known her my whole life!
  - 'Problem is, she won''t stop making cherry pies. '
  - 'Every day, we eat three cherry pies. '
  - 'Sometimes four if she''s feeling fruity. '
  - You know what that does to a man?
  - ...
  - 'I can''t take it anymore. '
  - Blink, I hate to say it, but there's only one solution to this problem.
  - ...
  - ...
  - I need you to kill my wife.
  - Can you do me this solid?
  - 'Great! Glad I can count on ya, buddy. '
  - 'Come back when the deed is done. '
